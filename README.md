Artificial intelligence search. Genetic algorithm and simulated annealing.
This code aims to provide results to the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) on different data sets.

Python files contain the two algorithms.

Tour files are the results, run on the same set of data for the two algorithms.
The final report of eperimentation and results for the project is included.
